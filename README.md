# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I’m a researcher in protein engineering, structural biology, protein illustration, and computational chemistry, specializing in the evolutionary and epistatic analysis of the mutational landscape in Glutathione Peroxidase Protein. I’m passionate about bridging the gap between science and art, leveraging my experience in editorial/review processes and scientific/non-scientific presentations to foster communication and collaboration in research.
